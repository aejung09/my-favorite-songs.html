  <p>You don't bring home roses<br>
You just bring home stress<br><br>
You never say I look good<br>
When I'm looking my best (No, no)<br><Br>
And if we're staying up all night<br>
It's 'cause you're moaning<br>
And not the good kind<br><br>
Want you to be happy<br>
But not at my expense<br><br>
The more I listen and I listen<br>
The more I'm thinking<br><br>
You don't need a girlfriend<br>
You just need a therapist<Br>
You got too much drama<br>
I'm not qualified to fix<Br>
I would hold your body<Br>
But you want somebody<br>
That will hold your shit together<Br>
You don't need a girlfriend<br>
Truth is<br><br>
I wanna make you feel good<br>
And put your mind at ease<Br><br>
But I'm just where you pour out the negativity<Br><br>
I'll get you excited<br>
I tried and tried it<br>
But it's so one sided<Br>
And I'm getting tired of fighting for somebody<br>
Who ain't fighting for me<Br><Br>
The more I listen and I listen<br>
The more I'm thinking<br><br>
You don't need a girlfriend<br>
You just need a therapist<br>
You got too much drama<br>
I'm not qualified to fix<br>
I would hold your body (Ah)<br>
But you want somebody (Nah)<br>
That will hold your shit together<br>
You don't need a girlfriend<br>
Truth is<br>
You need a therapist<br><br>
La la la la, la la (Yeah, yeah)<br>
La la la la, la la<br><br>
If I spend all my time, all my energy<Br>
Taking care of you who gonna take care of me?<Br>
If I spend all my time, all my energy on you, on you<Br>
If I spend all my time, all my energy<Br>
Taking care of you who gonna take care of me?<br>
I can't spend all my time, all my energy on you<br><br>
'Cause you don't need a girlfriend<br>
You just need a therapist (No, no, no)<br>
You got too much drama<Br>
I'm not qualified to fix (I ain't qualified to fix, yeah)<br>
I would hold your body<br>
But you want somebody<Br>
That will hold your shit together<br>
You don't need a girlfriend (Oh, the truth is)<br>
You need a therapist<br><br>
La la la la, la la (Yeah, yeah)<br>
La la la la, la la (Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)<br>
La la la la, la la (La da da, la la)<br>
Truth is<br>
